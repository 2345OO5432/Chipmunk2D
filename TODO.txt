High Priority:
	Document ChipmunkMultiGrab, update example code.
	Add license to showcase code. (and example code)
	Redo AngryChipmunks as Cocos2D 2.x
	Check that SpacePatrol and CloudBomber work when Cocos2D 2.1 is released.
	Release new Showcase app with push mode.
	Investigate getting better PhysicsEditor support.
	Reorganize Chimpnuk Pro directory structure. Too flat and confusing.
	Bilinearly sampled image sampler function. (override the sample method to always take bilinear samples)
	RGB Image Sampler class.
	User definable fast collision filtering.
	Add assertions so that you can't construct (or maybe add?) a constraint with NULL bodies.

Tutorial ideas:
	AG tilemap tutorial
	Fishing
	Crayon Ball clone

Demo Ideas:
	More UIKit examples? There are a surprising number of questions on this.
	Redo Logosmash with more particles?! :D
	Motorcycle in a spinning cage
	Squid thingy like TomorrowPlusX. (Would be better with seg/seg collisions)
	Sticky surfaces
	Simple top down player controls.
	Top down racing game. (Need the callback constraint)

Future things to think about:
	Convert body between static/dynamic.
	breakable object support functions?
	Finish the contact point generation branch.
	Implement segment-segment collisions
	Finish smooth line collisions
	Serialization
	Improve the ACD splitting plane algorithm.
	Tests for the query methods
	Building bodies from shape collections.
	Per body iterations and timestep?
	Per body damping and gravity coefs?
	Easy callback programable joint?
	cpBodyActivateStatic() should also activate joints?
	Figure out why poly contacts can sometimes be unstable when driven by a strong constraint
	Assertion for destroying a body with things still attached
