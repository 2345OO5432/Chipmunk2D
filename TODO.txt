High Priority:
	Document ChipmunkMultiGrab, update example code.
	Add license to showcase code. (and example code)
	Release new Showcase app with push mode.
	Make a Cocos2D helper pack (ChipmunkSprite, ChipmunkDebugNode, ES2 renderer)
	Investigate getting better PhysicsEditor support.
	Call cpBodyAssertSane from setters.
	Reorganize Chimpnuk Pro directory structure. Too flat and confusing.
	cpSpaceAddPostStepCallback() should return a TRUE if the callback was scheduled.
	Bilinearly sampled image sampler function. (override the sample method to always take bilinear samples)
	RGB Image Sampler class.
	User definable fast collision filtering.
	Add a user data pointer to cpArbiters!
	Add assertions so that you can't construct (or maybe add?) a constraint with NULL bodies.

Tutorial ideas:
	AG tilemap tutorial
	ByteRacer/ChipmunkPro
	Fishing
	Crayon Ball clone

Demo Ideas:
	More UIKit examples? There are a surprising number of questions on this.
	Redo Logosmash with more particles?! :D
	Motorcycle in a spinning cage
	Squid thingy like TomorrowPlusX. (Would be better with seg/seg collisions)
	Sticky surfaces
	Simple top down player controls.
	Top down racing game. (Need the callback constraint)

Future things to think about:
	Finish smooth line collisions
	Serialization
	Improve the ACD splitting plane algorithm.
	Convert body between static/dynamic.
	Tests for the query methods
	Building bodies from shape collections.
	Per body iterations and timestep?
	Per body damping and gravity coefs?
	breakable object support functions?
	Easy callback programable joint?
	cpBodyActivateStatic() should also activate joints?
	Finish the contact point generation branch.
	Figure out why poly contacts can sometimes be unstable when driven by a strong constraint
	Implement segment-segment collisions
	Assertion for destroying a body with things still attached
