High Priority:
	Make the ACD code not suck
	Finish smooth line collisions
	Serialization

Tutorial ideas:
	C/Blocks tutorial
	AG tilemap tutorial
	AG CCRenderTexture example
	AG CGContext example
	Fishing
	Crayon Ball clone

Demo Ideas:
	Crane demo
	Redo Logosmash with more particles?! :D
	Motorcycle in a spinning cage

Future features to think about:
	Tests for the query methods
	Building bodies from shape collections.
	Make functions to convert C to Obj-C types?
	Per body iterations and timestep?
	Per body damping and gravity coefs?
	breakable object support functions?
	Easy callback programable joint?
	cpBodyActivateStatic() should also activate joints?
	GJK or other closest points algorithm?
	Extreme vertex BSP search for polys
	Redo poly-poly contact manifold
	Implement segment-segment collisions
