Priorities:
	Simple top down player controls.
	* test tiny omega bug in cpvslerp().
	User definable default winding.
	Return 0/invalid normal when beginnig a raycast inside a shape.
	User definable fast collision filtering.
	Assertion (or warning?) for destroying a body with things still attached
	Add assertions so that you can't construct (or maybe add?) a constraint with NULL bodies.
	Bilinearly sampled image sampler function. (override the sample method to always take bilinear samples)
	RGB Image Sampler class.
	Convert body between static/dynamic.
	More UIKit examples? There are a surprising number of questions on this.
	Reorganize Chimpnuk Pro directory structure. Too flat and confusing.
	Improve the ACD splitting plane algorithm.
	Fishing game
	Redo Logosmash with more particles?! :D
	Motorcycle in a spinning cage
	Squid thingy like TomorrowPlusX. (Would be better with seg/seg collisions)

	Investigate getting better PhysicsEditor support.

Unordered
	Fix solver issues with the groove joint.
	Use a slop tolerance on joint boundaries.

Website things
	Google analytics
	Make it so people can upgrade license versions
	Don't make any mistakes: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/185773/the_top_10_mistakes_tool_.php
	Several people want a Chipmunk Facebook page.

Future things to think about:
	breakable object support functions?
	Serialization
	Tests for the query methods
	Building bodies from shape collections.
	Per body iterations and timestep?
	Per body damping and gravity coefs?
	Easy callback programable joint?
	Top down racing game. (Need the callback constraint)
	cpBodyActivateStatic() should also activate joints?
