High Priority:
	Disable HastySpace threads by default.
	Document the new nearest point query functions. (review)
	Document cpConvexHull() and cpPolyShapeNew().
	Document ChipmunkMultiGrab, update example code.
	Make a blog post/video about (QHull, ACD, NPQ, and blocks)
	Add license to showcase code.
	Make a Cocos2D helper pack (ChipmunkSprite, ChipmunkDebugNode, ES2 renderer)
	Investigate getting better PhysicsEditor support.

Tutorial ideas:
	C/Blocks tutorial
	AG tilemap tutorial
	AG CCRenderTexture example
	AG CGContext example
	Fishing
	Crayon Ball clone

Demo Ideas:
	More UIKit examples? There are a surprising number of questions on this.
	Redo Logosmash with more particles?! :D
	Motorcycle in a spinning cage
	Squid thingy like TomorrowPlusX. (Would be better with seg/seg collisions)
	Sticky surfaces
	Simple top down player controls.
	Top down racing game. (Need the callback constraint)

Future things to think about:
	Finish smooth line collisions
	Serialization
	Improve the ACD splitting plane algorithm.
	Convert body between static/dynamic.
	Tests for the query methods
	Building bodies from shape collections.
	Per body iterations and timestep?
	Per body damping and gravity coefs?
	breakable object support functions?
	Easy callback programable joint?
	cpBodyActivateStatic() should also activate joints?
	Extreme vertex BSP search for polys
	GJK or other closest points algorithm?
	Redo poly-poly contact manifold
	Figure out why poly contacts can sometimes be unstable when driven by a strong constraint
	Implement segment-segment collisions
	Assertion for destroying a body with things still attached
